Citi Bike is a private bicycle sharing service in New York City. This is a subsample of the Citi Bike and contains information about demand between different stations. The file contains a random sample of taken from June 1, 2017
to May 31, 2018 (31,452 out of 15.7 million rides). Data was collected at the Central Park, NYC weatherstation (WBAN Number: 94728) and matched by date and time to Citi Bike trips. The records indicate thegeneral weather for the NYC area during the ride and are not specific to the weather at any Citi Bikestation.Citi Bike has two basic user types. A customer buys a temporary pass (a 24-hour pass or 3-day pass). A
subscriber purchases access to bicycles for an entire year. Because subscribers register with Citi Bike,

The file contains these following fields:
Customer_prop: The proportion of Customers
DemandDate: the date the bicycle was rented, and the trip started
DemandTime: the time of day (daytime vs evening) the bicycle was rented, and the trip started
DayOfWeek: the day of week the bicycle was rented, and the trip started
Month: the month the bicycle was rented, and the trip started
Demand: the number of trips between the start station and the end station
StartStationId: A unique ID for the station from which the bicycle was rented (the ‘start’ of the trip)
StartStationName: Name (often the street location) of the start station
StartStationLatitude, StartStationLongitude: Latitude and Longitude of the start station
StartNeighborhood: General neighborhood of the start station (e.g., East Harlem, Soho, Park Slope)
Similar fields are defined for the End station (EndStationId, EndStationName,EndStationLatitude,EndStationLongitude, EndNeighborhood).
TripDurationMinutes: average duration of trips starting at the start station and ending at the end station,in minutesDistanceMiles: Approximate distance between start and end station, for trips starting at the start station
and ending at the end station, in miles. For example, in row two, DistanceMiles= 0.8489, which means
that the approximate distance for trips that started in StartStationId 83 and ended in EndStationId 3368 is
0.8489 miles.
MilesPerHour: Approximate speed of the trip, based on the trip duration and the distance between
stations (we assume – possibly incorrectly – that the trip was direct travel between stations)
StartCommuteTime, EndCommuteTime: The mean travel time in minutes spent commuting to work in
the neighborhoods where the trip started and ended.
Temperature: The temperature (in Fahrenheit) at the Central Park weather observation station at the start
of the trip.
DailySnow: The total snow falls in inches that day at the Central Park weather station.
DailyPrecipitation: Total precipitation in inches that day at the Central Park weather station.
StartPerCapitaIncome, EndPerCapitaIncome: The mean income for each person living in the
neighborhoods where the trip started and ended. It is calculated by dividing the aggregate income of the
residents by the total number of residents in the neighborhood.
StartPctHouseholdsNoVehicle, EndPctHouseholdsNoVehicle: The percentage of households in the
neighborhoods at the start and end of the trip that report not having a vehicle available.

**ALSO**
 Here are the absolute correlation values:

- Demand and Temperature: 0.0207
- Demand and DailySnowFall: 0.0014
- Demand and DailyPrecipitation: 0.0008
- Demand and Customer_prop: 0.0165
- Demand and StartPerCapitaIncome: 0.3218
- Demand and StartPctHouseholdsNoVehicle: 0.3892
- Demand and EndPerCapitaIncome: 0.1824
- Demand and EndPctHouseholdsNoVehicle: 0.3258
- Demand and TripDurationMinutes: 0.0023
- Demand and DistanceMiles: 0.0069

Based on these values, the variables that have a stronger association with the Demand variable (in terms of absolute correlation) are:

1. StartPctHouseholdsNoVehicle: The correlation coefficient is 0.3892, indicating a moderately positive association. This suggests that areas with a higher percentage of households with no vehicle may have a higher demand for bike trips.

2. StartPerCapitaIncome: The correlation coefficient is 0.3218, indicating a moderate positive association. This suggests that areas with higher per capita income may have a higher demand for bike trips.

3. EndPctHouseholdsNoVehicle: The correlation coefficient is 0.3258, indicating a moderately positive association. This suggests that areas with a higher percentage of households with no vehicle at the end point may have a higher demand for bike trips.

These variables show relatively stronger associations with the Demand variable compared to other variables in the dataset. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and further analysis is required to establish any causal relationships between these variables and bike trip demand.
